% Here is text on Materials and Methods.

% \subsection{A descriptive heading about methods}

\section{Model}
%Text here ===>>>
Consider a flow with a Froude number ${\rm Fr} = \upsilon/c_{\rm g} = \upsilon/\sqrt{g H}\approx 1$, where $\upsilon$ is the flow speed, $c_{\rm g}$ is the velocity for propagation of gravity waves, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $H$ is the depth of the flow. Assume also that the flow has a lateral width $L$ perpendicular to the flow such that the volumetric flow rate $\dot{V} = H L \upsilon$.

At low flow velocities (i.e., ${\rm Fr} \sim 1$), we can neglect generation of acoustic energy from cavitation, and so we will assume that the flow sound arises from interactions between the flow and the river bed. We expect that the acoustic power generated per unit area at the base of the flow $P_{\rm base}$ should scale with the flux of kinetic energy. The flow kinetic energy per volume $k$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    k = \rho \upsilon^2,\label{eqn:kinetic_energy_per_volume}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the fluid density. The flux of kinetic energy $f$ across the surface perpendicular to the flow direction and with area $H L$ is therefore given by
\begin{equation}
    f = \rho \upsilon^3. \label{eqn:kinetic_energy_flux}
\end{equation}
Therefore, $P_{\rm base} \propto \upsilon^3$. Since we have assumed ${\rm Fr} \sim 1$, $\upsilon \sim \sqrt{g H}$. This assumption implies 
\begin{equation}
    P_{\rm base} \propto \left( g H \right)^{3/2}.\label{eqn:P_base_in_terms_of_H}
\end{equation}

For a given volumetric flow rate, we have $H = \dot{V}/\left( L \upsilon\right)$, and so
\begin{equation}
H = g^{-1/3} \left( \frac{\dot{V}}{L} \right)^{2/3}.\label{eqn:H_in_terms_of_Vdot}
\end{equation}

Plugging this equation into Equation \ref{eqn:P_base_in_terms_of_H} gives
\begin{equation}
    P_{\rm base} \propto g \left( \frac{\dot{V}}{L} \right).\label{eqn:P_base_in_terms_of_Vdot}
\end{equation}

Now, we want to estimate the acoustic signal that emerges from the top of the flow, the signal that is actually measured. Assuming an exponential decay from the bottom of the flow to the top gives the following relationship for the acoustic power per area at the top of the flow $P_{\rm top}$:
\begin{equation}
    P_{\rm top} = P_{\rm base} e^{-\alpha H} \propto g \left( \frac{\dot{V}}{L} \right) e^{-\alpha g^{-1/3} \left( \dot{V}/L \right)^{2/3}},\label{eqn:P_top_in_terms_of_P_base}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the appropriate acoustic extinction coefficient. 

We can non-dimensionalize Equation \ref{eqn:P_top_in_terms_of_P_base} by defining $r \equiv \alpha \left( \frac{\dot{V}}{g^{1/2} L} \right)^{2/3}$. This replacement gives
\begin{equation}
    g \left( \frac{\dot{V}}{L} \right) = \left( \frac{r g}{\alpha} \right)^{3/2},\nonumber
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    P_{\rm top} \propto r^{3/2} e^{-r}.\label{eqn:nondimensional_P_top}
\end{equation}
This model of acoustic energy generation predicts a maximum at $r = 3/2$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:P_top_scaling}.

% To create multiline equations, use the

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting

% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}
